# EV Charging Station Analytics

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing the performance of Electric Vehicle (EV) charging stations using **Excel** and **Power BI**.  
It provides insights into key metrics such as revenue, station uptime, energy utilization, and customer sessions — helping stakeholders make data-driven decisions to optimize operations and improve charging infrastructure efficiency.

---

## Objective
To design a visually interactive **Power BI Dashboard** that tracks and measures EV charging station performance, usage patterns, and overall profitability using real-world-like data.

---

## Tools & Technologies Used
- **Excel** → Data cleaning, preprocessing, and CSV handling  
- **Power BI** → Data modeling, DAX measures, and visualization

## Key Insights & KPIs
The dashboard highlights several key performance metrics:

| **KPI**                       | **Description**                                                |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Total Charging Sessions**   | Total number of sessions completed.                            |
| **Total Revenue**             | Total revenue generated from all charging stations.            |
| **Average Charging Duration** | Total charging time accumulated across sessions.               |
| **Average Downtime**          | Total time chargers were non-operational or under maintenance. |
| **Total Energy Delivered**    | Total electrical energy supplied to EVs.                       |
